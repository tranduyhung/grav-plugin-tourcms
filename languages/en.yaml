This setting has no impact when a tour operator uses this API method on their own website.<br>Quality control explanation: If you are a web affiliate sending traffic through to the suppliers website then turn quality control on to only return tours where TourCMS is confident web tracking of bookings is in place. If - rather than sending traffic to the suppliers website - you are using the API to input web bookings or enquiries then you don''t need to worry about leakage via insufficient web tracking, hence can leave the quality control off. Also ensures tours meet certain image and description length criteria.'
